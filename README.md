This repository contains the analysis workflow for the manuscript entitled "The genome sequence of the Australian filarial nematode, *Cercopithifilaria johnstoni*"

Abstract: "We present a genome assembly and annotation of an individual female *Cercopithifilaria johnstoni*, a filarial parasitic nematode that is transmitted by hard ticks (Ixodidae) to infect a broad range of native Australian murid and marsupial hosts. The genome sequence is 76.9 Mbp in length, and although in draft form (N50 = 99 kbp, N50[n] = 232), is largely complete based on universally conserved orthologs (BUSCOs; genome = 94.9%, protein = 96.5%) and relative to other related filarial species. These data represent the first genomic resources for the genus *Cercopithifilaria*, a group of parasites that have a broad host range, and form the basis for comparative analysis with the human-infective parasite, *Onchocerca volvulus*, both of which are responsible for similar eye and skin pathologies in their respective hosts."

Any reuse of data or code is encouraged with due acknowledgement, either via citation of the published manuscript (when available) and/or GitHub repository. Comments, suggestions, and discussion are welcome.

Note: while much effort is made to make all data and code available, some of the code is very specific to the Sanger HPC environment and will need to be modified to work elsewhere. If you are interested in using any of it for your own work, but are stuck, please do get in touch.
